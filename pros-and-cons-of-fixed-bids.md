Pros: 
-The price will not increase unexpectedly
-The cost risk is with the developer
-Simple
Cons:
-If the developer does the job in less time or with fewer materials than I expected, I will overpay
-Loss of control: I can't necessarily change specifications later

In conclusion: It depends on what project you want to do. If it is a small project with specific goals, a fixed bid is best.
