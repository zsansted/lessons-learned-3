# lessons-learned-3

The goal of this repo is to capture some of they key takeaways from the Digital Literacy class that you think will be most useful going forward. Everyone should individually think of a single, specific takeaway that they found really valuable from the class.

One member of each group should fork this repo and then add the rest of your group members as collaborators to your fork so they can all commit directly to your repo.

Take a few minutes to discuss what each of you will work on, and each of you should create a distinct feature branch with a meaningful name. There might be branch names like "questions-to-ask-when-hiring" or "using-github-to-check-work". Each branch should have a specific name (not something really general like "managing-software-development" or "hiring") and be named based on a short summary of the takeaway you want to focus on.

Once you've created a feature branch, create a file with a similar name (e.g. questions-to-ask-when-hiring.md) and create a markdown file that is more than 50 words but less than 500 and summarizes the takeaway. Make sure to include at least one link and one image, so you'll have to learn the basics of "GitHub flavored markdown". Also make sure to write meaningful commit messages.

Once everyone has created a branch and made at least one commit containing their file, @mention the rest of your team and ask them for feedback. Make sure to provide a quick piece of substantive feedback on everyone elses pull request - doing so will improve your grade. Based on the feedback you receive on your PR, make any improvements and @mention everyone asking for a :+1: to ship. Once you get at least two, merge in the PR.

Once all the PR's have been closed, submit a PR to this repo to let me know you're done. Feel free to @mention @peterbell if any questions!
