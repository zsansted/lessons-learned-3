When specifying software, think of the main features that you are trying to provide to your user and formulate a type of story in the following structure: As a (user) I want to have a (feature) so that I can (benefit). While you might have the same feature used by two different users, the benefit/purpose of using that feature could vary for different users. This exercise could result in a rather large number of stories. However, one of the most challenging parts of this exercise is to narrow down these stories to a limited number that you are confident represent the key pillar features without which your venture could not operate. Once your team has implemented these stories, you can go ahead and add further features!

Other methods for specifying software include "job" specifications rather than specific feature specifications.
